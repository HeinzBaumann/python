Python Training


Introduction:
Setup on systems
Installing Python
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the latest version for your OS
Follow the instructions from the web page and from within the installer. (Ensure python exec folder is on your PATH, it should prompt you during the installation.)
        Create a folder develop in your Documents folder. 
Create a folder pythonTraining under develop. (This is the folder we will work in for this class.)
        Start python3 by typing python3 in your develop/pythonTraining folder. If everything is correctly installed you should get a new prompt that looks like this: 
Python 3.11.2 (main, Feb 16 2023, 02:51:42) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
Type exit() to exit out of the python interpreter.
Your python installation is completed. If you don’t have that. Let me know when I am in the office on Monday 8/4 and I fix your setup. 


Installing Visual Code
Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and select the installation for your OS. Follow the instructions for the installation.
Once the installation is complete you should have a new icon    for visual studio code on your desktop, application launch bar or application menu.
When you launch visual studio code you should have something like this:
  
        
You are all ready to go.


Next you can open the folder side bar in Visual Studio Code and select Open Folder. Navigate to our pythonTraining folder and open that in VS Code. 


Writing your first python code “Hello World”:
Open a new file (menu File, New File)
Name it “helloworld.py”. Follow UI prompts to create the file.
VS Code will recognize the py extension as Python and will treat the file accordingly, check syntax errors, color codes and present help strings.
Paste the following code into the file you created, save the file:
# Hello world
print("Hello world!")
        
On the menu bar navigate to View and select Terminal. The screen split and you have a terminal window on the bottom (it should be in your working directory that we opened earlier.)
Execute the python script by typing in that terminal window: 
Python3 helloworld.py <return>
It should prompt Hello World!


You are all set with your setup for the class.

        Getting started / Basic syntax


* How much Computer science know how do you have?
* How much do you already know about Python?


Useful places to get help;

Preferred language by data scientists because it has easy syntax and many data query libraries built in for easy data analysis.
Where to find help: 
   * Google search (AI)

        # comments
        No semicolons to end a line, but it requires correct indentation! 
        Variables
                Unless in other language, python will automatically assign the correct type:
                i = 0 # integer
                i = “World” # string
                i = 0.0 # float
                Global vs. local variables


        >>> use helloworld.py as the example for a simple condition


Functions
        Easy data mining we see later when we look at the json object.


Coding directly in the python interpreter
>>> i = 0
>>> print(i)
0
>>> i = i + 2
>>> print(i)
2
>>> if i < 2: 
...     print("Hello")
... elif i > 1:
...     print("Bonjour")
... 
Bonjour
>>> def myFunction(i):
...     if i == 0:
...             print("Hello")
...     elif i == 1:
...             print("Bonjour")
...     else:
...             print("Error")
... 
>>> myFunction(0)
Hello
>>> myFunction(1)
Bonjour
>>> myFunction(2)
Error

        myUserInput.py


        List:
is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple
is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set 
is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary 
is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.


*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.


**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
